# Garmin Grafana

A docker container to fetch data from Garmin servers and store the data in a local influxdb database for appealing visualization with Garfana.

> [!TIP]
> If you are a **Fitbit user**, please check out the [sister project](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/fitbit-grafana) made for Fitbit

## Dashboard Example

![Dashboard](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana/blob/main/Grafana_Dashboard/Garmin-Grafana-Dashboard-Preview.png?raw=true)

## Install with Docker (Recommended)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Install docker if you don't have it already. Docker is supported in all major platforms/OS. Please check the [docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). You can install it on Windows via WSL, on Unraid via Docker Compose plugin, on Proxmox via Docker-LXC, and natively on Linux and Mac.

1. Create a folder named `garmin-fetch-data`, cd into the folder. Then create a folder named `garminconnect-tokens` inside the current folder (`garmin-fetch-data`) with the command `mkdir garminconnect-tokens`. Run `chown -R 1000:1000 garminconnect-tokens` to change the ownership of the garminconnect-tokens folder (so the `garmin-fetch-data` container's internal user can use it to store the Authentication tokens)

2. Create a `compose.yml` file inside the current `garmin-fetch-data` folder with the content of the given [compose-example.yml](./compose-example.yml) ( Change the environment variables accordingly )

3. You can use two additional environment variables `GARMINCONNECT_EMAIL` and `GARMINCONNECT_BASE64_PASSWORD` to add the login information directly. otherwise you will need to enter them in the initial setup phase when prompted. If you are not using these environment variables to pass your garmin Connect login informations, you must remove them altogether (remove the full lines including the variable names or comment out with a `#` in front of the variable names) from the compose file - leaving them to placeholder values or empty values might lead to invalid login attempt and possibily `401 Client Error`. Please note that the password must be encoded with [Base64](http://base64encode.org/) when using the `GARMINCONNECT_BASE64_PASSWORD` ENV variable. This is to ensure your Garmin Connect password is not in plaintext in the compose file. The script will decode it and use it when required. If you set these two ENV variables and do not have two factor authentication (via SMS or email), you can directly jump to `step 5`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are planning to use Influxdb V3, you need to enter the admin access token in `INFLUXDB_V3_ACCESS_TOKEN`. To generate the admin token you should run `docker exec influxdb influxdb3 create token --admin` command. This will give you the admin token which you must update to `INFLUXDB_V3_ACCESS_TOKEN` ENV variable. You can do this only once and the token can't be viewed or retrieved ever again (influxdb only stores a hash of it in the database for comparison). So please store this token carefully. 

4. If you did not set up the email and password ENV variables or have 2FA enabled, you must run the following command first to get the Email, password and 2FA code prompt interactively: `docker pull thisisarpanghosh/garmin-fetch-data:latest && docker compose run --rm garmin-fetch-data`. Enter the Email, Password (the characters will be visible when you type to avoid confusion, so find some privacy. If you paste the password, make sure there is no trailing space or unwanted characters), and 2FA code (if you have that enabled). Once you see the successful authentication message followed by successful data fetching in the stdout log, exit out with `ctrl + c`. This will automatically remove this orphan container as this was started with the `--rm` flag. You need to login like this **only once**. The script will [save the session Authentication tokens](https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect/issues/213#issuecomment-2213292471) in the container's internal `/home/appuser/.garminconnect` folder for future use. That token can be used for all the future requests as long as it's valid (expected session token lifetime is about [one year](https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect/issues/213), as Garmin seems to use long term valid access tokens instead of short term valid {access token + refresh token} pairs). This helps in reusing the authentication without logging in every time when the container starts, as that leads to `429 Client Error`, when login is attempted repeatedly from the same IP address. If you run into `429 Client Error` during your first login attempt with this script, please refer to the troubleshooting section below. 

5. Finally run : `docker compose up -d` ( to launch the full stack in detached mode ). Thereafter you should check the logs with `docker compose logs --follow` to see any potential error from the containers. This will help you debug the issue, if there is any (specially read/write permission issues). if you are using docker volumes, there are little chance of this happending as file permissions will be managed by docker. For bind mounts, if you are having permission issues, please check the troubleshooting section.

7. Now you can check out the `http://localhost:3000` to reach Grafana (by default), do the initial setup with the default username `admin` and password `admin`, add influxdb as the data source. Please note the influxdb hostname is set as `influxdb` with port `8086` so you should use `http://influxdb:8086` for the address during data source setup and not `http://localhost:8086` because influxdb is a running as a separate container but part of the same docker network and stack. Here the database name should be `GarminStats` matching the influxdb DB name from the docker compose. The query language used for the dashboard is `influxql` which is supported by both InfluxDB 1.x and 3.x, so please select that from the language dropdown during setup. Use the same username and password you used for your influxdb container (check your docker compose config for influxdb container, here we used `influxdb_user` and `influxdb_secret_password` in default configuration) Test the connection to make sure the influxdb is up and reachable (you are good to go if it finds the measurements when you test the connection)

8. To use the Grafana dashboard, please use the [JSON file](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana/blob/main/Grafana_Dashboard/Garmin-Grafana-Dashboard.json) downloaded directly from GitHub or use the import code **23245** to pull them directly from the Grafana dashboard cloud.

9. In the Grafana dashboard, the heatmap panels require an additional plugin you must install. This can be done by using the `GF_PLUGINS_PREINSTALL=marcusolsson-hourly-heatmap-panel` environment variable like in the [compose-example.yml](./compose-example.yml) file, or after the creation of the container very easily with docker commands. Just run `docker exec -it grafana grafana cli plugins install marcusolsson-hourly-heatmap-panel` and then run `docker restart grafana` to apply that plugin update. Now, you should be able to see the Heatmap panels on the dashboard loading successfully.

10. If you are in mainland China and use Garmin-cn account you need to set `GARMINCONNECT_IS_CN=True`

If you have come this far, everything should be working. If not, please check the **troubleshooting section** for known issues. If it is already working, **CONGRATULATIONS!**. Enjoy your dashboard and keep exercising!. If you like the dashboard and my sincere effort behind it, please **star this repository**. If you enjoy it a lot and want to show your appreciation and share the joy with me, feel free to [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/A0A84F3DP). Maintaining this project takes a lot of my free time and your support keeps me motivated to develop more features for the community and spend more time on similar projects. if you are having any trouble, feel free to open an issue here, I will try my best to help you!

---

This project is made for InfluxDB 1.11, as Flux queries on influxDB 2.x can be problematic to use with Grafana at times. In fact, InfluxQL is being reintroduced in InfluxDB 3.0, reflecting user feedback. Grafana also has better compatibility/stability with InfluxQL from InfluxDB 1.11. Moreover, there are statistical evidence that Influxdb 1.11 queries run faster compared to influxdb 2.x. Since InfluxDB 2.x offers no clear benefits for this project, there are no plans for a migration.

Support of current [Influxdb 3](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb3/core/) OSS is also available with this project [ `Experimental` ]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that InfluxDB 3.x OSS limits the query time limit to 72 hours. This can be extended more by setting `INFLUXDB3_QUERY_FILE_LIMIT` to a very high value with a potential risk of crashing the container (OOM Error). As we are interested in visualization long term data trends, this limit defeats the purpose. Hence, we strongly recommend using InfluxDB 1.11.x (default settings) to our users as long as it's not discontinued from production. 

Example `compose.yml` file contents is given here for a quick start.

> [!TIP]
> The Docker image is also available as `ghcr.io/arpanghosh8453/garmin-fetch-data:latest` alongside `thisisarpanghosh/garmin-fetch-data:latest`.

### Additional configuration and environment variables

✅ The Above compose file creates an open read/write access influxdb database with no authentication. Unless you expose this database to the open internet directly, this poses no threat. If you share your local network, you may enable authentication and grant appropriate read/write access to the influxdb_user on the GarminStats database manually if you want with `INFLUXDB_ADMIN_ENABLED`, `INFLUXDB_ADMIN_USER`, and `INFLUXDB_ADMIN_PASSWORD` ENV variables during the setup by following the [influxdb guide](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/influxdb/README.md) but this won't be covered here for the sake of simplicity.

✅ You can also enable additional advanced training data fetching with `FETCH_ADVANCED_TRAINING_DATA=True` flag in the compose file. This will fetch and store data such as training readiness, hill score, VO2 max, and Race prediction if you have them available on Garmin connect. The implementations of this should work fine in theory but not thoroughly tested. This is currently an experimental feature. There is no panel showing these data on the provided grafana dashboard. You must create your own to visualize these on Grafana.

✅ By default, the pulled FIT files are not stored as files to save storage space during import (an in-memory IO buffer is used instead). If you want to keep the FIT files downloaded during the import for future use in `Strava` or any other application where FIT files are supported for import, you can turn on `KEEP_FIT_FILES=True` under `garmin-fetch-data` environment variables in the compose file. To access the files from the host machine, you should create a folder named `fit_filestore` with `mkdir fit_filestore` inside the `garmin-fetch-data` folder (where your compose file is currently located) and change the ownership with `chown 1000:1000 fit_filestore`, and then must setup a volume bind mount like this `./fit_filestore:/home/appuser/fit_filestore` under the volumes section of `garmin-fetch-data`. This would map the container's internal `/home/appuser/fit_filestore` folder to the `fit_filestore` folder you created. You will see the FIT files for your activities appear inside this `fit_filestore` folder once the script starts running.

✅ By default indoor activities FIT files lacking GPS data are not processed (Activity summaries are processed for all activities, just not the detailed intra-activity HR, Pace etc. which are included only inside the FIT files and require additional processing power) to save resources and processing time per fetched activity. If you want to process all activities regardless of GPS data availabliliy associated with the activity, you can set `ALWAYS_PROCESS_FIT_FILES=True` in the environment variables section of the `garmin-fetch-data` container as that will ensure all FIT files are processed irrespective of GPS data availability with the activities.  

✅ If you are having missing data on previous days till midnight (which are available on Garmin Connect but missing on dashboard) or sync issues when using the automatic periodic fetching, consider updating the container to recent version and use `USER_TIMEZONE` environment variable under the `garmin-fetch-data` service. This variable is optional and the script tries to determine the timezone and fetch the UTC offset automatically if this variable is set as empty. If you see the automatic identification is not working for you, this variable can be used to override that behaviour and ensures the script is using the hardcoded timezone for all data fetching related activities. The previous gaps won't be filled (you need to fetch them using historic bulk update method), but moving forward, the script will keep everything in sync. 

✅ Want this dashboard in **Imperial units** instead of **metric units**? I can't maintain two separate dashboards at the same time but here is an [excellent step-by-step guide](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana/issues/27#issuecomment-2817081738) on how you can do it yourself on your dashboard!

## Collecting periodic watch battery levels

Unfortunately, Garmin Connect does not sync the device battery level (possibly due to infrequent passive syncing intervals). Hence, it's not possible to get the watch's battery data directly using this setup. However, I have found an alternative, which requires a lot of additional setup (out of the scope for this project - but I will give a brief walkthrough). 

You will need a self-hosted/cloud instance of [homeassistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and [GarminHomeAssistant (Watch Application) from Connect IQ](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/61c91d28-ec5e-438d-9f83-39e9f45b199d). Detailed installation instructions are [available here](https://github.com/house-of-abbey/GarminHomeAssistant). This application is Free and open source as well just like this project, and the maintainer is very supportive! 

After you install it, you need to enable the battery level and other stats collection (background running) in the application settings on Connect IQ. You will see the battery level history on HomeAssistant entities panel (appearing as `sensor.garmin_device_battery_level`) thereafter. If you want to integrate this data to the InfluxDB database and Grafana dashboard you have with this project, you need to add an additional InfluxDB addon configuration in the `configuration.yaml` file of HomeAssistant installation like following. 

```yaml
influxdb:
  host: influxdb
  port: 8086
  database: GarminStats
  username: influxdb_user
  password: influxdb_secret_password
  ssl: false
  verify_ssl: false
  max_retries: 3
  include:
    entities:
       - sensor.garmin_device_battery_level
  tags:
    source: hass
```
There is a Grafana panel in the dashboard (given with this project) which displays this data when available. If you do not have this setup, you should remove that panel from the dashboard, as battery data collection is not possible from the watch otherwise.  

## Historical data fetching (bulk update)

> [!TIP]
> Please note that this process is intentionally rate limited with a 5 second wait period between each day update to ensure the Garmin servers are not overloaded with requests when using bulk update. You can update the value with `RATE_LIMIT_CALLS_SECONDS` ENV variable in the `garmin-fetch-data` container, but lowering it is not recommended, 

#### Procedure

1. Please run the above docker based installation steps `1` to `4` first (to set up the Garmin Connect login session tokens if not done already).

2. Stop the running container and remove it with `docker compose down` if running already

3. Run command `docker compose run --rm -e MANUAL_START_DATE=YYYY-MM-DD -e MANUAL_END_DATE=YYYY-MM-DD garmin-fetch-data` to update the data between the two dates. You need to replace the `YYYY-MM-DD` with the actual dates in that format, for example `docker compose run --rm -e MANUAL_START_DATE=2025-04-12 -e MANUAL_END_DATE=2025-04-14 garmin-fetch-data`. The `MANUAL_END_DATE` variable is optional, if not provided, the script assumes it to be the current date. `MANUAL_END_DATE` must be in future to the `MANUAL_START_DATE` variable passed, and in case they are same, data is still pulled for that specific date. 

4. Please note that the bulk data fetching is done in **reverse chronological order**. So you will have recent data first and it will keep going back until it hits `MANUAL_START_DATE`. You can have this running in background. If this terminates after some time unexpectedly, you can check back the last successful update date from the container stdout logs and use that as the `MANUAL_END_DATE` when running bulk update again as it's done in reverse chronological order.

4. After successful bulk fetching, you will see a `Bulk update success` message and the container will exit and remove itself automatically. 

5. Now you can run the regular periodic update with `docker compose up -d`

## Update to new versions

Updating with docker is super simple. Just go to the folder where the `compose.yml` is and run `docker compose pull` and then `docker compose down && docker compose up -d`. Please verify if everything is running correctly by checking the logs with `docker compose logs --follow`

> [!CAUTION]
> If you run `docker compose down -v`, that (using the `-v` flag) will purge the persistant docker volumes for the influxdb (if you are using docker volumes - default setup) which will wipe out all the data and databases stored in the influxdb container. Please be careful about this action but it can be useful if you want to start fresh wiping out the old database and container. This action cannot be undone. 

## Backup Database

Whether you are using a bind mount or a docker volume, creating a restorable archival backup of your valuable health data is always advised. Assuming you named your database as `GarminStats` and influxdb container name is `influxdb`, you can use the following script to create a static archival backup of your data present in the influxdb database at that time point. This restore points can be used to re-create the influxdb database with the archived data without requesting them from Garmin's servers again, which is not only time consuming but also resource intensive. 

```bash
#!/bin/bash
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%F_%H-%M)
BACKUP_DIR="./influxdb_backups/$TIMESTAMP"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"
docker exec influxdb influxd backup -portable -db GarminStats /tmp/influxdb_backup
docker cp influxdb:/tmp/influxdb_backup "$BACKUP_DIR"
docker exec influxdb rm -r /tmp/influxdb_backup"
```

The above bash script would create a folder named `influxdb_backups` inside your current working directory and create a subfolder under it with current date-time. Then it will create the backup for `GarminStats` database and copy the backup files to that location. 

For restoring the data from a backup, you first need to make the files available inside the new influxdb docker container. You can use `docker cp` or volume bind mount for this. Once the backup data is available to the container internally, you can simply run `docker exec influxdb influxd restore -portable -db GarminStats /path/to/internal-backup-directory` to restore the backup.

Please read detailed guide on this from the [influxDB documentation for backup and restore](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1/administration/backup_and_restore/)


## Troubleshooting

- The issued session token is apparently [valid only for 1 year](https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect/issues/213) or less. Therefore, the automatic fetch will fail after the token expires. If you are using it more than one year, you may need to stop, remove and redeploy the container (follow the same instructions for initial setup, you will be asked for the username and password + 2FA code again). if you are not using MFA/2FA (SMS or email one time code), you can use the `GARMINCONNECT_EMAIL` and `GARMINCONNECT_BASE64_PASSWORD` (remember, this is [base64 encoded](http://base64encode.org/) password, not plaintext) ENV variables in the compose file to give this info directly, so the script will be able to re-generate the tokens once they expire. Unfortunately, if you are using MFA/2FA, you need to enter the one time code manually after rebuilding the container every year when the tokens expire to keep the script running (Once the session token is valid again, the script will automatically back-fill the data you missed)

- If you are getting `429 Client Error` after a few login tries during the initial setup, this is an indication that you are being rate limited based on your public IP. Garmin has a set limit for repeated login attempts from the same IP address to protect your account. You can wait for a few hours or a day, or switch to a different wifi network outside your home (will give you a new public IP) or just simply use mobile hotspot (will give you a new public IP as well) for the initial login attempt. This should work in theory as [discussed here](https://github.com/matin/garth/discussions/60).

- Running into `401 Client Error` when trying to login for the first time? make sure you are using the correct username and password for your account. If you enter it at runtime, it should be in plaintext but if you add it with environment variables in the docker compose stack, it must be [Base64 encoded](https://www.base64encode.org/). if you are 100% sure you are using the right credentials, and still get this error, it's probably due to the fact that you are connected to a VPN network which is preventing the log in request (see issue [#20](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana/issues/20)). If you are not using a VPN, then please try running the container with mobile hotspot network or with a VPN exit tunnel (both gives you a different public IP) - you need to try this from a different network somehow. 

- If you want to bind mount the docker volumes for the `garmin-fetch-data` container, please keep in mind that the script runs with the internal user `appuser` with uid and gid set as 1000. So please chown the bind mount folder accordingly as stated in the above instructions. Also, `grafana` container requires the bind mount folders to be owned by `472:472` and `influxdb:1.11` container requires the bind mount folders to be owned by `1500:1500`. If none of this solves the `Permission Denied` issue for you, you can change the bind mount folder permission as `777` with `chmod -R 777 garminconnect-tokens`. Another solutiuon could be to add `user: root` in the container configuration to run it as root instead of default `appuser` (this option has security considerations)

- If the Activities details (GPS, Pace, HR, Altitude) are not appearing on the dashboard, make sure to select an Activity listed on the top left conner of the Dashboard (In the `Activity with GPS` variable dropdown). If you see no values are available there, but in the log you see the activities are being pulled successfully, then it's due to a Grafana Bug. Go to the dashboard variable settings, and please ensure the correct datasource is selected for the variable and the query is set to `SHOW TAG VALUES FROM "ActivityGPS" WITH KEY = "ActivitySelector" WHERE $timeFilter`. Once you set this properly after the dashboard import, the values should show up correctly in the dropdown and you will be able to select specific Activity and view it's stats on the dashboard.

- Missing the battery levels data on the dashboard? Check out the section titled `Collecting periodic watch battery levels` to know how to set it up.
